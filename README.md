=====================================================================================================================================

Front-end Developer
-------------------

I have a strong foundation in Javascript and have experience with Typescript. I have experience working with a variety of API architectures, including REST and GraphQL. I am proficient in using these technologies to fetch data and manipulate it within the front-end of a web application. In terms of frameworks and libraries, I am well-versed in React and Angular. I have used both of these frameworks to build responsive and user-friendly web applications. Additionally, I have experience with state management libraries such as Redux and React-Query, as well as the Apollo client for working with GraphQL APIs. I am also skilled in using CSS preprocessors such as SASS and have experience with modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Styled-Components. This allows me to write clean, maintainable, and scalable CSS for my projects.
